**Project Description:**

This project aims to analyze movie reviews using text mining techniques, specifically Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) and Naive Bayes algorithms. The study will utilize the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique to visualize the results and explore trends and patterns in the data.

**Methodology:**

The study will collect movie reviews from online sources using [OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). The collected data was then used to train Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) and Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBC) to predict the sentiment of movie reviews. UMAP was employed to visualize the results in a lower-dimensional space, facilitating the exploration of patterns and trends in the data.

**Datasets:**

Two datasets were generated using the generative AI tool, namely "Labelled.csv" and "Unlabelled.csv". The "Labelled.csv" dataset contains 1140 rows of positive and negative movie reviews, serving as the basis for evaluating the performance of the classification models. The best-performing algorithm will be deployed on the "Unlabelled.csv" dataset, which contains 30 rows of positive and negative movie reviews.

**Potential Impact:**

The findings of this study could provide valuable insights for the movie industry. By leveraging sentiment analysis of movie reviews, stakeholders can identify areas for improvement in productions, marketing strategies, and public relations efforts. Additionally, UMAP visualization could offer insights into audience preferences and trends, informing decision-making processes within the industry.

**Deliverables in this project:**

- Python code files implementing SVC and NBC classification algorithms.
- PDF report (**Critical Analysis.pdf**) containing critical analysis of the approach and results covering the mentioned key points.
